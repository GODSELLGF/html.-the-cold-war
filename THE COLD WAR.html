        <h1>COLD WAR</h1>


        <p style="font-size:30px">The term "cold war" was coined by English writer George Orwell at the end of World War II in his essay "You and the Atomic Bomb."  Following the end of
             World War II, in 1947, the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies, the Western and Eastern Blocs,
             entered a period of geopolitical tension that lasted until 1991. The reason the two superpowers did not engage in extensive direct combat but instead 
             backed opposing forces in significant regional conflicts known as proxy wars is why the phrase "cold war" was coined. The ideological and geopolitical
              fight for global dominance between these two superpowers, which stemmed from their positions as Allies in the Second World War and their eventual 
              victory over Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945, was the basis of the war.
              The United States led the Western Bloc, along with many other First World countries that were mostly liberal democratic and capitalist in nature,
               but connected to a network of Third World countries that were mostly former colonies of European powers and frequently authoritarian in nature. 
               The Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which ruled over much of the Second World and was connected to a network of autocratic nations, served as
                the leaders of the Eastern Bloc. In its satellite territories, the Soviet Union imposed communist regimes and maintained a command economy.</p>

                <h1>THE SETTING</h1>


                <p style="font-size:30px">Some historians contend that the Cold War started in 1917 when the Bolsheviks toppled the Russian Provisional Government in the Russian Republic,
                     however most historians place its beginnings in the years immediately following World War II. The US entered World War I as an Associated Power
                      in April 1917, joining the British, French, and Russian Empires as the main Allied Powers from the outset. Following the Bolshevik takeover,
                       the brutal Red Terror was unleashed to crush any and all resistance, real or imagined.[14] The Central Powers and the Bolsheviks signed an 
                       armistice in December, but by February 1918, hostilities had returned. The Soviet Union withdrew from the conflict in March and signed a 
                       separate peace treaty. 
                       A million German soldiers were freed for the Western Front, and a large portion of Russia's food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies,
                        and contacts with Western Europe were given up, all of which some Allies believed were helping Germany win the war. Historian Spencer Tucker 
                        states that "the Allies believed the treaty to be the ultimate betrayal of their cause and to have planted the seeds for the Cold War".
                        Some Bolsheviks saw Russia as only the first step, planning to incite revolutions against capitalism in every western country, but the need
                         for peace with Germany led Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin away from this position.
                         Britain supported the White movement, a loose coalition of anti-Bolshevik parties, in 1918 with both cash and military forces. Winston Churchill,
                          the Minister of War, led this policy and was a staunch opponent of communism. Between the Reds and the Whites, a protracted and brutal Civil War 
                          broke out in 1917, culminating in the Reds' victory in 1923. The famine of 1921, which claimed the lives of over five million people, foreign 
                          interference, and the execution of the previous Emperor and his family were among them. Despite their limited success, Soviet Russia attempted to
                           retake all of the newly independent countries that made up the former Empire. While the Red Army captured Ukraine, Belarus 
                           (as a result of the Polish-Soviet War), Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania all repulsed Soviet assaults.</p>

                           <p style="font-size:30px">Following World War II, the US and the USSR, along with their respective allies, developed an open but restrained rivalry that would eventually
                             become known as the Cold War. Let's examine the factors that contributed to this momentous historical era: Different Political Beliefs: The political
                              and economic philosophies of the USSR and the USA were diametrically opposed. The Soviet Union promoted communism, whereas the United States supported
                               democracy and capitalism. Tensions and mistrust were heightened by these divergent worldviews. Post-World War II Geopolitical Changes: The alliance
                                between the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union during the war started to fall apart once Nazi Germany was defeated. 
                                Concerns about Soviet dominance in the region lasting arose when the Soviet Union installed left-wing governments in Eastern European nations 
                                freed by the Red Army. The United States and Great Britain Western European communist parties under Soviet influence were a threat to the United States
                                 and Great Britain. Weapons Race: In an effort to surpass one another in terms of military prowess, the two superpowers fought a fierce weapons race.
                                  Tensions around the world increased when nuclear weapons were developed and this competition intensified. The German Issue: Cold War tensions 
                                  were heightened by the partition of Germany into an East (run by the Soviet Union) and a West (run by the United States, Great Britain, and France).
                                   Relations were further strained in 1948 by the Berlin Blockade. Creation of Military Alliances: The Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) were founded.
                                    NATO was made up of the United States and Western European states, whereas the Warsaw Pact was made up of Eastern European countries that supported the Soviet Union.
                                    Ideological disagreements, geopolitical scheming, and the persistent threat of nuclear war sum up the Cold War. It had a long-lasting influence on international
                                     relations and impacted world politics for decades.

           <h1> THE BEGINNING OF COLD WAR</h1>       
        
           
           <p style="font-size:30px">George F. Kennan's "Long Telegram" from Moscow to Washington in late February 1946 contributed to the formulation of the US government's increasingly tough 
            stance towards the Soviets, which would serve as the cornerstone of US policy towards the Soviet Union for the remainder of the Cold War. The message sparked a 
            discussion on policy that ultimately shaped the Soviet policy of the Truman administration. Washington's hostility to the Soviet Union grew as a result of
             Stalin and Molotov's betrayals on Iran and Europe. Iran was occupied by the British in the south and the Red Army in the far north after the Anglo-Soviet
              invasion during World War II. 
              The United States and Britain relied on Iran as a supply source for the Soviet Union, and the Allies committed to leaving Iran six months after hostilities ended.
              But when this deadline arrived, the Soviets continued to operate in Iran under the pretexts of the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad and the Azerbaijan People's Government.
               Winston Churchill, the former prime minister of the United Kingdom, gave his renowned "Iron Curtain" speech at Fulton, Missouri, on March 5, shortly afterward. 
               In his speech, he demanded an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviet Union, accusing them of dividing Europe with a "iron curtain" that stretched from
                "Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic".
                Stalin reacted forcefully to Churchill's speech a week later, on March 13. He claimed that Churchill was similar to Adolf Hitler in that he supported the racial
                 superiority of English-speaking countries in order to sate their hunger for global dominance and that such a declaration amounted to "a call for war on the USSR."
                 Early in 1947, attempts by France, Britain, and the United States to come to an accord with the Soviet Union over a plan that envisioned Germany as economically
                  self-sufficient, including a thorough accounting of the industrial plants, goods, and infrastructure previously taken over by the Soviets, were met with failure. 
                  The United States implemented the Marshall Plan in June 1947 as part of the Truman Doctrine, promising financial support to any willing European nation,
                   including the Soviet Union. President Harry S. Truman signed the plan on April 3, 1948, and it called for the US to give Western European nations about $13 billion
                    (or $189.39 billion in 2016) in order to reconstruct the continent's economy. Subsequently, the initiative produced the OECD. </p>

             <p style="font-size:30px">From 1922 to 1991, the Soviet Union, also known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR),was established on December 30,1922. It emerged in post-revolutionary Russia and
                 comprised a confederation of several regions; Russia, Belorussia now called Belarus, Ukraine, Transcaucasian Federation which was later divided in 1936 into Grorgia, Azerbajan,
                  Armenia. Moscow served as the capital of the Soviet Union and is currently the capital of Russia. With its vast territory extending from the Baltic and Black seas to the Pacific Ocean,
                   the Soviet Union was the largest nation in the world at the time it was in existence. It included the following fifteen Soviet Socialist Republics: Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia,
                    Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kyrgyzstan. With more than a hundred different nationalities residing there, the community
                     was extraordinarily diversified. East Slavs (Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians) comprised the bulk of the population; in the late 1980s, they accounted for almost two thirds of
                      the entire population.  was a transcontinental nation that covered a large portion of Eurasia. 
                 Originally a federal union of fifteen national republics, the largest and most populous of which was the Russian SFSR, the nation was the successor state to the Russian Empire. 
                 However, until its latter years, both its economy and government were heavily centralised. It was a showcase communist state, run by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
                  as a one-party system. The Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR were approved by a conference of plenipotentiary delegations 
                  from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, and the Byelorussian SSR on December 28, 1922, thus establishing the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
                   The first Congress of Soviets of the USSR endorsed these two documents, which were signed on December 30, 1922, by the chiefs of the delegations, Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya,
                    Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Petrovsky, and Alexander Chervyakov. The official declaration was delivered from the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre stage. Beginning in 1917, during the early stages 
                    of Soviet dominance, there was a significant reorganisation of the nation's industries, politics, and economy. Vladimir Lenin's signature on official documents known as the
                     Bolshevik Initial Decrees guided most of this.  The Soviet Union encompassed an area of roughly 8,650,000 square miles (22,400,000 square kilometres) at its peak between 1946 and 1991,
                      which is seven times larger than India and two and a half times larger than the United States2. The Soviet Union had a tremendous impact on world history up to its collapse and disintegration in 1991.</p>

                      <h2>THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION</h2>
                      
                      <p style="font-size:30px">The process of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' (USSR) dissolution led to the end of the nation as a sovereign state and its federal government, which in turn led to the full independence
                         of its 15 constituent republics on December 26, 1991. This was known as the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It put an end to General Secretary (and President) Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts to change
                          the political and economic structure of the Soviet Union in an effort to break through a period of impasse in politics and economic decline. Ethnic separatism and internal stagnation had plagued
                           the Soviet Union. Despite remaining highly centralised until its very end, the nation was composed of fifteen elite republics that provided various ethnic groups with homelands.
                           Gorbachev, the leader of the USSR began to lose authority over two areas of the Soviet Union in 1988, when the Caucasus broke out into civil war and violence, and the Baltic states began to move
                            towards independence. During the final day of the intense 19th Party Conference on July 1, 1988, Gorbachev managed to get the support of the weary delegates with his last-minute suggestion to 
                            establish the Congress of People's Deputies as a new supreme legislative body. Enraged by the opposition from the old guard, Gorbachev started a series of constitutional amendments in an effort 
                            to try and separate party and state and isolate his Party rivals. On October 2, 1988, comprehensive plans for the new Congress of People's Deputies were released in order to facilitate the formation
                             of the new legislature. During its session from November 29 to December 1, 1988, the Supreme Soviet amended the Soviet Constitution of 1977, passed a law pertaining to electoral reform, and 
                             scheduled the election for March 26, 1989.
                             On the other hand, structuralist explanations adopt a more deterministic stance, positing that the disintegration of the Soviet Union was the result of deeply ingrained structural problems that 
                             planted a time bomb. For instance, Edward Walker has argued that while minority nationalities faced several challenges, including a culturally destabilising form of economic modernization, 
                             powerlessness at the Union level, and some Russification, they were also fortified by a number of Soviet government policies (such as the support for local languages and the indigenousization of leadership).
                              They developed aware nations over time. Secession and independence were also made easier by the fundamental fiction that supported the Soviet federative system—that it was a consensual union of allied peoples.
                               On January 25, 2016, Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, supported that view by calling Lenin's support of the right of secession for the Soviet republics a "delayed-action bomb". 
                              "The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl 20 years ago this month, even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union," Gorbachev wrote in an opinion piece
                               published in April 2006. Many were taken aback by the Soviet Union's collapse. Many believed that the fall of the Soviet Union was unlikely or impossible prior to 1991.It also had a significant effect 
                               on the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) policy-making circles, particularly on CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping, who asks, "Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate?" What caused the Soviet Union's Communist
                                Party to lose power? A significant contributing factor was the fierce ideological conflict that produced historical nihilism and disoriented thought by entirely rejecting the history of the Soviet Union,
                                 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin. The military was no longer commanded by the Party, and all Party organs had ceased to exist.</p>

               <h1>THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION (NATO)</h1>     
               
               <p style="font-size:30px">The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a 31-member, intergovernmental military alliance made up of two North American and 29 European nations. Founded in the wake of World War II, the organisation carried out the North Atlantic Treaty,
                 which was signed on April 4, 1949, in Washington, D.C. NATO is a system of collective security in which the sovereign members pledge to protect one another from outside threats. NATO served as a check on the Soviet Union's
                  threat during the Cold War. The alliance, which has participated in military actions in the Middle East, South Asia, Africa, and the Balkans, remained in existence following the fall of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.
                   Animus in consulendo liber, which translates to "a mind unfettered in deliberation" in Latin, is the organization's motto. Headquaters in Brussels, Belguim.
                In the immediate wake of World War II, British diplomacy laid the groundwork for NATO's formation in order to restrain the Soviet Union and halt its spread throughout Europe. The three Benelux nations—Belgium,
                 the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—were added to the 1947 defensive pact between the United Kingdom and France by the 1948 Treaty of Brussels, which also committed the parties to a fifty-year collective defence 
                 against armed attack. In 1949, the British and Washington collaborated to enlarge the alliance into NATO, which included the US and Canada in addition to Italy, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. West Germany joined in
                  1955, Greece and Turkey joined in 1952, and Spain joined in 1982, 1999 saw the entry of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland; 2004 saw the entry of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, 
                  and Slovenia; 2009 saw the entry of Albania and Croatia; 2017 saw the entry of Montenegro; 2020 saw the entry of North Macedonia; and 2023 saw the entry of Finland.
                  Throughout the Cold War and its aftermath, NATO's organisational structure changed. NATO's integrated military organisation was initially created in 1950 when it became evident that the alliance would need to strengthen
                   its defences in the long run in order to fend off a possible Soviet attack. SHAPE, the headquarters of Allied Command Europe, was founded in April 1951. Four further subordinate headquarters were eventually added in
                    Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean. </p>

<h1>THE END OF COLD WAR</h1>             

<p style="font-size:30px">Significant historical events signalled the gradual end of the Cold War. The communist bloc's unity broke down during the course of the 1960s and 1970s. China and the Soviet Union broke up, and certain Western nations and Japan became
     economically independent. Smaller countries rebelled against the influence of superpowers as international interactions became increasingly complex. The real turning point, though, occurred during Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership. 
     He started the changes that attempted to democratise the Soviet political system and altered the most autocratic elements of the government. Eastern European communist governments began to fall, paving the way for the emergence of
      democratic administrations in nations including Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and East Germany. West and East Germany eventually reunited under NATO supervision.
      The Soviet Union itself fell apart in late 1991, giving rise to fifteen new independent countries, including a Russia under the leadership of an anticommunist leader. As a result, the disintegration of the Soviet Union marked the
       official end of the Cold War and the period of hostility and terror between the US and the USSR. 
       </p>


       <h1>AFTERMATH</h1>

       <p style="font-size:30px">"The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance," said Vladislav Zubok, summarising the events' global consequences.
        Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia significantly reduced its military budget and restructured its economy, creating millions of jobless workers.Neoliberal changes in Russia led to a recession in the early 1990s 
        that was worse than the Great Depression that the US and Germany went through, according to Western interpretation. According to Western analysts, in the twenty-five years since the end of the Cold War, only five or six post-communist
         states are headed towards economic and capitalist integration, while the majority are lagging behind, some to the point where it will take them several decades to catch up to pre-collapse levels. The Vietnam and Korean Wars, the dissolution
          of the Warsaw Pact, the falling of the Berlin Wall, the reunification of Germany, and the political and economic downfall of the Soviet Union were among the numerous consequences of the war. Along with several Soviet and Baltic States gaining
           their independence, the end of the Cold War also signalled the end of communism worldwide.
